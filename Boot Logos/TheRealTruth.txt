A True Advocates Desktop (or, I Just Hate Windows!)
___________________________________________________

Enclosed within this archive are two images, one BMP, one OS/2 boot logo.
The BMP is 640x480x16.7 million colors.
The boot logo is 640x480x16 colors.
The image is not copyrighted, however the OS/2 logo, etc, is a registered
trademark of IBM.
Having said that, take the BMP file, make it your desktop background, or 
that of a Win95 machine you have access to, for hours of enjoyment! :)

If you like it, drop me a line, I have plans for a Win95 installation disk,
peeled back revealing the true disk below, DOS 6.22!, as well as any others 
I (or you) can think of.:) I have to justify my new E3 scanner somehow!
