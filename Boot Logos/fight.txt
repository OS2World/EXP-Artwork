Bootlogo for OS/2 Warp - in Manga-style.

There are a few groups to publish OS/2 related paperbooks and programs
at "Comic Market" in Japan. My "Nutshell" is a group of them.
This fight.lgo was one of my products published at Comic market 58,
Aug 12, 2000, and it was well received by my friends.
I hope you like this.

!! This bootlogo is for Warp 4 or higher.
Don't use this on older version of OS/2.
