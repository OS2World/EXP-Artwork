Alex's OS/2 Boot Logos 

Starting with FixPak 13 for OS/2 Warp 4, a short white-on-black version string
is printed at the bottom left corner of the boot logo screen, over top of the
logo graphic. (This behaviour also occurs in OS/2 Warp Server for e-business).
In my humble view, this tends to stick out like a sore thumb on the bright
blue default boot logo.

My idea was to create some new boot graphics which were already dark in the
lower left corner, thereby hopefully making the version string a bit less
intrusive.

    bluegrad.lgo     OS/2 Warp banner on an inclined blue gradient.                      

    blueibm.lgo      Much the same, but with the IBM logo.

    blueibm2.lgo     Another IBM-logo version, but with a horizontal gradient.

    dblgrad.lgo      A double gradient.  No drop shadow on the IBM logo.

    dblgrad2.lgo     The same double gradient, but the OS/2 banner is a
                     different shade.

    wseb.lgo         This is a logo designed for Warp Server for
                     e-business, a.k.a. Aurora.                             

Do not attempt to use any of the above logos on a Warp 3 system! They are
designed for Warp 4 or Aurora only.  

    wserver.lgo      This file is for Warp Server; it may be used on a Warp
                     3 system.


To replace the OS/2 boot logo, rename the .LGO file to 'OS2LOGO', and replace
the system, hidden, and read-only file 'OS2LOGO' in the root of the boot
drive. The new file must have the same flags set. For example:

   [C:\]attrib -s -h -r OS2LOGO
   [C:\]move OS2LOGO \OS2\INSTALL\DEFAULT.LGO
   [C:\]ren BLUEGRAD.LGO OS2LOGO
   [C:\]attrib +s +h +r OS2LOGO
