Evil Grey Alien boot logo for OS/2.

OBSCURA! has made it easy to replace your standard boot screen logo with a GREY alien.
Follow the simple instructions or you will be abducted.

IMPORTANT SAFETY TIP!
=====================

OS/2 Warp includes a program object titled "Create Utility Diskettes" in the 
System Setup Folder.  This object will create boot diskettes in case you cannot 
boot from your hard drive.  But you must have these diskettes created *before* 
you need them!  If you don't already have some alternate means of booting OS/2, 
you should create these diskettes before changing the boot logo.

BACK UP the original OS2LOGO file.  I copied mine into "os2logo.org".  To copy 
it, you will first have to remove the attributes on the file.  This is done by
typing "attrib -s -h -r os2logo" at the OS/2 Command Prompt.

Changing the boot logo is as simple as copying 
"GREYBOOT.lgo" to "os2logo" on your boot drive.  You will have to remove the
attributes on "os2logo" before you can copy your new logo on.  This is done by
typing "attrib -s -h -r os2logo" at the OS/2 Command Prompt.  NOTE:  You should 
have already done this when you backed up your original OS2LOGO file.  You did 
back it up, didn't you?
