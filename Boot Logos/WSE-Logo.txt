
WSeB Bootlogos
==============

The bootlogo shipped with WSeB isn't perfect (wrong colored pixels), 
I cleaned up a little bit and added some stuff ...

aurora.lgo           new bootlogo with Aurora writing 
warp4.lgo            refreshed old Warp4 bootlogo
wseb.lgo             refreshed WSeB bootlogo
wsebhpfs386.lgo      refreshed WSeB bootlogo with HPFS386 writing 


Install
=======

On your boot drive in root is the hidden file OS2LOGO, remove the 
hidden/read only/system attribute with attrib command or take any 
file manager to do this, backup this file and replace it with one 
file from this package, change file name to OS2LOGO.

In short do the following [boot drive is c:\]:

 [1] attrib -r -h -s C:\OS2LOGO
 [2] copy C:\OS2LOGO C:\OS2LOGO.BAK
 [3] copy xxx.lgo C:\OS2LOGO


Enjoy !

Do not use these files with Warp 3 ! Use at your own risk !
