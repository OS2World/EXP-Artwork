Axe Pointer:

This is a mouse pointer set in the shape of a sword.  I was inspired but 
the StarTrek and New Hand glove pointer sets.  I started drawing pointers
in my spare time.  This is one of many in series of weapon pointers.
Look for other on your favorite OS/2 source.  Or call my BBS directly.
