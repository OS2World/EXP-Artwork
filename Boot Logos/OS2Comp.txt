	** The OS/2 Computing! Boot Up logos **

The following is the instructions for installing these series of logos
into your computer. Please follow the instructions while making the 
appropriate changes as you see fit to complete the replacement of the
OS/2 default boot up logo.

Installation:                                                                  

Unzip this zip file into the root directory of the OS/2 boot drive.
In the root directory of the OS/2 boot drive there is a file named
WELCOME??.LGO.  It is necessary to remove the read, hidden, and system
attributes from this file, make a backup copy, then rename the
WELCOME??.LGO file OS2LOGO.  Next time the computer is rebooted, the new
logo screen will appear.

C:\> attrib -r -s -h os2logo
___A_  c:\os2logo
